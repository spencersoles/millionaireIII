From GAMES magazine:

Millionaire III

Our first Millionaire contest ran in the very first issue of GAMES (September/October 1977), and a sequel appeared exactly one year later. It's taken us a long time, but we've finally figured out a suitable way to complete a Millionaire trilogy: simply by combining the rules from the first two contests.

In both Millionaire I and II, the object was to come up with a word with a value as close as possible to 1,000,000. A word's value was determined by multiplying together the values of each of its letters. Millonaire I used ascending letter values (A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, etc.); Millionaire II reversed this, with A = 26, B = 25, C =24, and so on. (See the Letter Values Chart below.) Using Webster's Third (Unabridged) as the dictionary of record, contestants were able to hit exactly one million in the first contest with the words TEAETTE and TYPEY. In the second contest, the words closest to 1,000,000 were HAWED, HEYDAY, and SHEND, each with a value of 999,856.

This time, the object is to come up with a word that comes as close as possible to 1,000,000 using each of the above letter-value systems. That is, you must first evaluate the word using the Millionaire I method and determine how close it is to 1,000,000; then evaluate the same word using the Millionaire II system, and again find its distance from 1,000,000. Note: You must express both distances between your word values and 1,000,000 as positive numbers, regardless of whether the word values are more than or less than 1,000,000. Thus, words with values of 1,000,144 and 999,856 would each have a distance (or difference) of 144 from 1,000,000.

Finally, add together your two word values' distances from 1,000,000 to get your score, which you want to be as low as possible. We doubt that a score of 0 can be achieved, since neither of the words known to score 0 under Millionaire I rules (TEATTE and TYPEY, as noted earlier) have values anywhere near 1,000,000 under Millionaire II rules.

Example: The word GAMES would score 7*1*13*5*19 = 8,645 under the Millionaire I rules, but 20*26*14*22*8 = 1,281,280 under Millionaire II. Its score for this contest would be (1,000,000 - 8,645) + (1,281,280-1,000,000) = 991,355 + 281,280 = 1,272,635
